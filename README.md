# Maze-Escape

This repository holds my senior project from high school. For the senior project, I had prepared and organized a programming competition for high school students to compete in. The rules for the competition are in the "Escaping the Maze" document.

Information to keep note of:
This project was specifically taylored for using the Eclipse IDE and a Windows computer. Contestants would be given the contents of the "Contestant" folder whereas I had the "Judge" folder.
I will also include the three solutions that did the best and a couple different solutions that I have written. One of them will be one I wrote when I held the competition and the other will be a more recent solution.

My reflections on my project:
I had opened the competition to all of the schools in the Brevard County school district but unfortunately only nine people from my own school had submitted their solutions. This is probably because Harris Corporation was holding a competition for the same school district at the same time. Their competition revolved around producing an Android application to accomplish certain tasks. Another issue I feel that happened was that the maps the users were given all can be solved by following a simple algorithm of finding the bottom right corner.
